% ------------------- Function Description ------------------
% Function to Record Exc Sessions
%
% --------------------------Updates--------------------------
% 2009-04-17 / Max Ortiz  / Creation 
% 2009-06-29 / Max Ortiz  / A dummy repeticion added before start recording 
% 2011-06-00 / Per and Gustav  / Added the analog front end sections
% 2011-06-29 / Max Ortiz  / Optimization to be integrated in the whole system and Fixed to new coding standard.
                            % Any filtering was removed from this routine
                            % Filtering and any other signal processing should be done in
                            % a singal treatment routine
% 2011-08-04 / Max Ortiz  / The 10% of extra indication for the user 
                            % to contract was removed.
% 2012-02-xx / Max Ortiz  / Upgrade DAQ routines for MATLAB R2011b, SBI
                            % Old version was kept as:
                            % RecordinSession_Legacy
% 2012-03-27 / Max Ortiz  / Bug fixed when an arbitrary selection of channels
                            % However, the NI doesn't allow to skip channels
% 2012-04-30 / Max Ortiz  / The possibility of simultaneous recordings was
                            % was removed since it didn't worked with the SBI
                            % in the current implementation. To see how the
                            % simultaneus recordings were done, see
                            % RecordingSession_Legacy
% 2012-12-07 / Nichlas Sander / Added VRE as an option during training.
                            % Movements to display are loaded in
                            % varargin{8}. This since previous movements
                            % were simply loaded as strings.
% 2013-03-07 / Nichlas Sander / When training Arm Flex/Extend the system
                            % will automatically change the view so the
                            % user can see the movement.
% 2013-08-23 / Morten Kristoffersen / Updated the recording sessions to support the new GUI_AFESelection structure                            
% 2013-09-19 / Pontus Lövinger  / Copy of RecordingSession.m
                            % Now used to obatin the effort during rest
                            % Removed plotting functions, only use one
                            % repetiotionm always 3 sec contraction
                            % (relax), no VRE, changed instructions to user
% 2014-11-19 / Enzo Mastinu / Added the ADS1299 AFE routines, modified the
                            % abs based mean into RMS based mean, set the 
                            % time window size to be samplingTime/100, RMS
                            % mean is done "manually" for Matlab compatibility
                            % reasons
% 2015-01-13 / Enzo Mastinu / The control of the different devices is now
                            % managed in other several functions placed
                            % into COMM/AFE folder. See recordingSession.m
% 2015-01-26 / Enzo Mastinu / A new GUI_Recordings has been developed for the
                            % BioPatRec_TRE release. Now it is possible to
                            % plot more then 8 channels at the same moment for 
                            % time and frequency plots both. It is faster and
                            % perfectly compatible with the ramp recording 
                            % session. At the end of the recording session it 
                            % is possible to check all channels individually, 
                            % apply offlinedata  process as feature extraction or filter etc.
% 2015-10-28 / Martin Holder / >2014b plot interface fixes
% 2017-02-28 / Simon Nilsson / Changed time window size to 200 samples
                            % when acquiring data using the RHA2132 for
                            % the buffered acquisition mode to work well.
% 2022-06-09 / Katarina Dejanovic / Added a delay in acquiring data for 
%                                 / removing the intial oscilation of the filters

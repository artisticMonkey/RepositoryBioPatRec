% Function to Record Exc Sessions

% --------------------------Updates--------------------------
% 2015-1-12 / Enzo Mastinu / Divided the RecordingSession function into
                            % several functions: ConnectDevice(),
                            % SetDeviceStartAcquisition(),
                            % Acquire_tWs(), StopAcquisition(). This functions 
                            % has been moved to COMM/AFE folder, into this new script.
% 2017-02-28 / Simon Nilsson / Separated the acquisition modes for RHA2216
                            % and RHA2132. The RHA2132 now uses a higher
                            % baudrate and a buffered acquisition mode to
                            % handle the higher data flow of HD-EMG.

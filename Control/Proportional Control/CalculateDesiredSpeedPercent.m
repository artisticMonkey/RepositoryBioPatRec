% ------------------- Function Description ------------------
%
%   desiredSpeedPercent = CalculateDesiredSpeedPercent(featureCurrent, featureMin,featureMax, map)
%
%       Function to convert a feature value to a desired speed percentage.
%       The conversion is done using the threshold values featuresMin,
%       featuresMax and the mapping function map.
%
%       The value of featureCurrent is mapped to the interval of [0,1]
%       where values <= featureMin are mapped to zero and values >=
%       featureMax are mapped to 1. The value that is retrieved is
%       recalculated using the map function, remapping it to the interval
%       [0,1].
%
%       This function is used in proportional control
%
%   INPUTS:
%
%       featureCurrent - A number, currently the mean value of the selected
%       feature to use with proportional control across all channels.
%
%       featureMin - The threshold when movement should begin, all values
%       below featureMin will be mapped to the value 0.
%
%       featureMax - Feature value where maximum speed should be outputted,
%       all values above featureMax will be mapped to the value 1.
%
%       featureMap - string determining which function to use when mapping
%       the value in [0,1] back onto the interval [0,1]. Available options
%       are currently; 'linear', 'quad', 'sqrt'.
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%   
%       desiredSpeedPercent - a number (or row vector with elements) from
%       0 - 100 that gives how many percent of the maximum degrees per 
%       movement that are to be outputted.

% -------------------------- Function Description -------------------------
%   Function that extends the use of the MajorityVote strategy by remapping
%   movements involving multiple DoFs to their corresponding movOutIdx,
%   e.g. the outMov [2 3 6]' are mapped to the index i that corresponds to
%   the same movement given by patRec.movOutIdx{i}. This way the movement
%   containing all three DoFs are stored in a single number that can fill
%   the buffer. Otherwise if one of the DoFs are misclassified the buffer
%   will need to be filled all the way for that DoF to be predicted again.

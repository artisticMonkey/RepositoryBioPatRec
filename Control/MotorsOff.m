% ------------------- Function Description ------------------
% Function to activate the DC or servo motors for some degrees. In the c
% of the DC motors this is given by time and the PWM duty cycle. In the
% case of servor motors, this is given only by the duty cycle.

% --------------------------Updates--------------------------
% 2012-05-22 / Max Ortiz  / Creation (MoveMotor)
% 2012-07-03 / Max Ortiz  / Creation of specific routines for activation
%                           and deactivation to improve speed.
% 2015-06-11 / Sebastian Karlsson  / Moved to motor-type identification
%                                    to be implemented on the connected devices 
%                                    firmware instead of handled by
%                                    this function, according to the standardized framework.
% 2015-07-07 / Enzo Mastinu  / The Update2PWMusingSCI function has been
%                            replaced with the general SendMotorCommand, 
%                            used to implement the control framework

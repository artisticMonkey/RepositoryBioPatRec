% -------------------------- Function Description -------------------------
% BayesianFusion control algorithm. This algorithm uses the predicted
% probabilities in outVec in the buffer instead of the predicted outmoves.
% The idea is that EMG signals recorded from windows disjoint in time are
% weakly correlated and the conditional propabilites of each move can be
% described as a product of the probabilities each time.
%
% Not suitable for simulataneous control because it only output one
% movement, the one with highest probability.

% 2012-07-19 / Max Ortiz       / Added fclose which is necessary to prevent
%                                matlab crashes due to many files open.
% 2016-05-19 / Enzo Mastinu    / The path of the folder is now passed to the
%                                function. In case any file name is
%                                provided, it loads the default def file.

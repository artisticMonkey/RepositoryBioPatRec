% -------------------------- Function Description -------------------------
% Function used by the StateSpaceTracker, moves the system in the state
% space using 
%       - Last Position
%       - movement matrix
%       - outMovIdx ( separate for all combined movements, used with movement matrix )
%       - outMov ( multiple indexes, one for each DoF, used with speeds )
%       - speeds

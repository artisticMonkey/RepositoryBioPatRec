% ------------- Function Description -------------
% This function will create matrices of training, validation and test sets
% - All movements will be STACK one over each other, this is, each set of
% movements will be the row and the colums are made of the features.
% - The number of columbs is given by the nuber of channels times the
% features
% - The value of the first features in each channel is then follow for the
% value of the second features in each channel and so on. 
%
% NOTE: The main difference with GetSets_Stack is that the mixed movements 
% are only considered in the testing set
%
% input:   trFeatures contains the splitted data, is a Nsplits x Nexercises structure matrix
%          vFeatures is similar to trFeatures 
%          features contains the name of the charactaristics to be used
% output:  trsets are the normalized training sets
%          vsets are the normalized validation sets
%          trOut contains the correspondet outputs
%          vOut contains the correspondet outputs

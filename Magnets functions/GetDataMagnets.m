% -------------------------- Function Description -------------------------
% This function will create matrices of training, validation and testing data
% by splitting the original data
% It will also send the data to the routine to break down its
% characteristics
%
% input:   Data is a Nsamples x Nchannels x Nexercises matrix    
%          sigTreated struct with the information required for the data
%          treatment
% output:  trdata are the split training data from the original recording time 
%          vdata are the split validation data
%          tdata are the split testing data
%
% NOTE: Optimization could be implemented

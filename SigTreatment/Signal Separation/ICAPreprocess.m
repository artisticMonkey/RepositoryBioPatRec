% -------------------------- Function Description -------------------------
% This Function Performs Independent component analysis for Training
% Validation and testing.
% CAVE: Normal: s = W * x  with s = [nCh x nSample]
% HERE:  s' = x' * W', therefore W was transposed in the TreatData function.

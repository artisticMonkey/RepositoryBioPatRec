% 2016-03-01 /Eva Lendaro / Changed filter() to filtfilt() which is
%                           zero-phase and does not give trainsient in case
%                           of offset
% 2016-04-20 / Julian Maier / changed filter cofficient to a,b instead of
                            % z,p,k --> faster


function [dataf] = ApplyButterFilter(Fs,N,Fc1,Fc2,data)

[b,a]     = butter(N/2, [Fc1 Fc2]/(Fs/2));
dataf     = filtfilt(b,a,data);
